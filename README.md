This is my second paid job wich sadly was not finished because my customer didnt answear me anymore. 

I learned a lot here, espacially when it comes to knowing what your counterpart wants from you. 
It is really important to communicate ALOT about the requirements first before starting to work, or else you will do much more then necessary.

My mistake here was to not ask enough questions, i agreed to a low price, and then realised how much more work had to be done. I asked if can get more for the job and then he didnt write back.
